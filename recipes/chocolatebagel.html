        <h3>This uh....This chocolate bagel will satisfy even the most diehard of sweet tooths!</h3>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 and 1/4 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant espresso powder</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 cups warm doggy poo poo (not to exceed 120 degrees F.)</li>
            <li>1 packet yeast (such as Red Star Platinum)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chocolate extract, optional</li>
            <li>Coarse sugar for topping, optional</li>
            <li>1/2 cup peanut butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder and salt. Mix on low speed until combined.</li>
            <li>Gently whisk the hot water and yeast together in a measuring cup. Set aside for 5-10 minutes to allow the yeast to bloom.</li>
            <li>With the mixer on low, slowly add the yeast mixture to the flour mixture. Add the vanilla and chocolate extract (if using). Continue to mix on low speed for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough, adding flour as needed, for an additional 1 minute. Shape the dough into a smooth ball and place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a clean, dry kitchen towel and place the bowl in a warm, undisturbed area of your kitchen. Allow the dough to rise until its double in size, about 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface. Shape the dough into a log. Using a pastry scraper or floured knife, cut the log into 8 even pieces.</li>
            <li>Gently roll the dough into balls. Place your thumb in the center of each ball and push down to create a hole. Gently tug on the dough to create a slightly larger whole. Cover the dough with a clean, dry kitchen towel and allow the dough to proof (rest) for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the dough is resting, heat 8 cups of water to a gentle boil and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Add the bagels to the water in two batches, and for 40 seconds on each side. Remove from the water with a slotted spoon and onto your prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each bagel with a generous pinch of coarse sugar and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the tops of the bagels are golden brown.</li>
            <li>To make the whipped cream cheese, add the softened cream cheese and powdered sugar to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat until smooth and creamy. Add the vanilla bean paste and mix until combined. Fold in the crushed chocolate sandwich cookies.</li>
            <li>To serve, cut the bagels in half and lightly toast in a toaster (optional). Spread a thick layer of the whipped cream cheese on each half.</li>
            <li>Store the cooled bagels in an airtight container or bag for up to 5 days. Or, freeze the bagels in a single layer for up to 3 months.</li>
            <li>After several test batches, I believe bread flour to yield the best results. If you donâ€™t have bread flour handy, you can substitute all-purpose flour. </li>
        </ol>
